\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this article, we presented a framework for probabilistic BAR systems. We introduced an algorithm to verify Nash-equilibrium properties in concurrent games with perfect and imperfect information at the level of global state knowledge. We performed our algorithm on two case studies, the 3-player Rock-Paper-Scissors example and Halpern et al.'s Secret Sharing protocol. Some results are interesting as they illustrate the necessity of a Byzantine player in a game to ``force'' the rational player to behave altruistically notably in the Rock-Paper-Scissors example. This opens a new door for Byzantine players, which are currently only considered as misconfigured or corrupted agents. Our algorithm is guaranteed to terminate (due to the maximum number of iterations) but the convergence may be not guaranteed if $V_i$ and $U_i$ converge to the same value. The analysis of this case is left to future work.
